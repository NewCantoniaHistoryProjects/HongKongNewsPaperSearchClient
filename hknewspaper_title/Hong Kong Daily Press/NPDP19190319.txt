page 4	The progress made by the allied representatives at Paris in framing the preliminary Peace Treaty has exceeded, we are told, the most optimistic expectations. America, Gt. Britain, France and Italy-the four Allied Powers principally concerned-are now in perfect accord upon practically every clause of the Treaty, which, it is believed, will be ready for submission to the delegates by the end of the week. It will be placed before the enemy delegates for signature shortly afterwards, is a responsible Government still exists in Germany-a matter for some doubt judging by the recent report of the conditions obtaining in the country.
