page 6	A series of documents issued by the United States Committee on Public Information prove the purely German origin of the Bolshevik revolution, and that Lenin and Trotsky and their associates are merely tools in the hands of the German General Staff. The documents are taken from the report made to the Committee on Pueblo Information Mr. Edgar Sisson, the Committee's specie representative in Russia during the winter of 1917-18.

page 7	Here is a story of cold-blooded butchery, without equal even in this war. It is the tale of a deliberate, systematic effort by the Bulgarians, extending over three months, to exterminate the national spirit of Serbia, by killing everyone in the parts of the country they occupied, whom they thought capable of maintaining it. To my mind, the facts, which I am about to relate, are crimes, which will earn for Bulgaria the odium of Civilisation.
