page 6	For the deadlock reached at the Shanghai conference it would appear, on the surface, as if the Southern delegates were responsible owing to their refusal to continue the negotiations unless the Tuchun of Shensi were dismissed. In China however, it is not always safe to take men or public performances at their face value. It is just possible that the Southern delegates may not have been quite so unreasonable as their decisions suggest. Indecd, it is not improbable that their action was taken as the result of consultation with their colleagues from the North. That this was the case cannot, of course, be definitely asserted, but support is lent to the idea by the subsequent reports as to the good understanding which prevails between the Northern and Southern delegates.

Among those presented to the President was the Rev Edward Booth, pastor of the church of which the Rev Edward Booth, pastor of the church of which the President's grandfather was minister over eighty years ago.
