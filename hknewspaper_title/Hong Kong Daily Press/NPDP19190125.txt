page 2	I am phased to contribute a few lines of reminiscences of my life in Hongkong. I remember leaving Dover one very dark and blowy night toward the end of 1882 in a small paddleboat, which made a very lively crossing. We joined the old P. & O. steamer Poonah at Brindisi.

page 4	It has been said that in the East the old adage that "nothing succeeds like success" applies with particular force. A consideration of the various phases of Great Britain's relations with China tends to confirm the statement. In the early days of the East India Company subordinate Chinese Mandarins trampled upon agreements made with Britsh traders and deliberately humiliated our countrymen in Canton.
