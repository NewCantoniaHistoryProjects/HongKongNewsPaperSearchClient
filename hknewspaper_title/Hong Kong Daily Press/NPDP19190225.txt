page 2	A DAY OF SURPRISES
page 2	The first great surprise came in the Victoria Stakes, when, contrary to all expectations, Malcolm beat Sandy, the favorite, and Spotted Sand, a pony that was very heavily backed on account of its work on the training track. Malcolm's win must be put down to the fine judgment which its rider displayed Almost to the very end the race seemed to be between Sandy and Spotted Sand. Grey Goose, another much fancied pony, did mot finish in the first five. The Pari-mutuel paid a dividend of $245.30 on Malcolm for a win, only eleven tickets having been taken on his chances. Curiously enough, however, it was backed so heavily for a place that a dividend of only $7.60 was paid.

page 4	The work in connection with the salt Gabelle, which Sir Richard Dane did so well for China, has recently been recognised by the Times, and like much good work that has been carried out by Britons in foreign countries, is will probably be appreciated more by future generations than by contemporaries. It is not altogether the fault of those who live in the sane era as pioneers that they fail thoroughly to appreciate the work of those pioneers.
