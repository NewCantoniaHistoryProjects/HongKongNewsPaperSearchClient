page 3	Through the courtesy of the Sanitary Board authorities we are enabled to give below, in tabular from, a comparative statement of the deaths registered in the Colony during 1918 and the two previous years. That the health of the Colony has not improved will be seen from the fact that 13,714 deaths were recorded last year, against 10,433 in 1917 and 10,558 in 1916. This increase was due in a large measure to the appearance in the Colony of influenza and cerebra-spinal fever, which were responsible for 405 and 936 deaths respectively.
