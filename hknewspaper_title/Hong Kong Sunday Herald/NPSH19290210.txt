page 1	In a well contested match noteworthy for clean, sporting vigour rather than for perfection in skill, Hong Kong beat Shanghai yeaterday in the Interport rugby football match by twelve points to six and thus retained the emblem (gained up North twelve months ago) that is "as dearly prized" out here as is the Calcutta Cup at Home.

page 8	NOTHING of the order unexpected or sensational is to be found in the finding of the Coroner's jury in regard to the appalling "Hsinwah" disaster and the inquest on the body of one of the Chinese victims. It almost approaches superfluity to return a verdict that "the cause of the victim's death was 'found drowned as the result of the ship's sinking.'"

page 18	The floating by Mr. Henry Ford of a British company with a capital of seven million pounds is an event of some importance in British industrial history, declares the "New Statesman." It evidently means the really serious entry of the Ford concern into the British Market, from which it has been partly driven of late years by the McKenna duties and the growth of the British production of cheap cars.
