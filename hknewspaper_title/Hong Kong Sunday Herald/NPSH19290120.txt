page 8	Decision arrived at at Nanking to reduce the Nationalist Army to something less than three-quarters of a million men. It is a notable and noteworthy decision, whether the deed will follow the word remains to be seen. Observers have put the total military strength in China at around a million and a half, ourselves, we would say it is well over two millions, including the soldiers-cum-bandits controlled by such war-lordlings as Yang Sen, who has been trying to perpetrate a particularly nasty piece of outlawry away in Szechuan.

It contains a row of 14 powerful lamps with a total of 3,000,000 candle power, sufficient to read a newspaper by a mile away. The light is spread so low over the ground that it will not "hit" into the eyes of the landing pilot.
