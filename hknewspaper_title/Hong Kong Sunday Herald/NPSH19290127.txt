page 6	The book is useful for reference, and gives slightly more than the ordinary synopsis, for those who may want to place and give song or incident, but it is not to be read for its own sake, except by the very uncritical. If you want to enjoy Gilbert and Sullivan, you must have their own words set to their own music and of that there is 'No possible doubt whatever.'
page 8	Playing With Our Water Problem
page 8	JUDGING by the many nice things that were said at the meeting of the Legislative Council on Thursday, and the spirit of self-congratulation that abounded, one might easily be deceived into believing that the problem of our water shortage had been solved and that all our difficulties in this direction were over.

page 19	While their owners were attending two dances the tyres of 40 cars, parked on a piece of waste land in Linthorpe-road Middles-brough, were slashed by someone unknown, and in most cases all four tyres were damaged, apparently by a sharp instrument. In some cases even the spare wheel was slashed.
