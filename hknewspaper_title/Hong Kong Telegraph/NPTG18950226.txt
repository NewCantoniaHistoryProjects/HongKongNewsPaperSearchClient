page 2	What is civilization? According to Gulzot, "The fundamental idea of civilization is progress, or development. It subsists upon two conditions and manifests itself by two symptoms, viz. The development of social activity and that of individual activity." So, to-day, if we turn to the West, we find everything in as transitory state morally and politically creeds falling thrones crumbling, nothing fixed, nothing sure. To-morrow may bring about a revolution, which will shake the present structure of society to its very foundations and capsize the whole existing order of things.
