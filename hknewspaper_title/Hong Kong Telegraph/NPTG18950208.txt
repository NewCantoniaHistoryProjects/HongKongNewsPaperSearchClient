page 2	Liuku_gtao, 2nd February-On the istlnstant the enemy's fleet made another to force the eastern entrance of the bor. But so hot was our fire from both fleet and the forts at that end that we succeeded in destroying three of the enemy's torpedo boats, and caused two others to be towed in a sinking condition by other boats undamaged or by launches. There were alto three armoured cruisers. Viz.: the I oshino. Fuse and one similar to the Itsuskushima, which were observed to be well battered by our s_eils, and two of them, the Yoshino and the Fuso, were badly disabled; the latter listed on one side so much as to be evidently in a singing condi_on. The damage to the Fuso was by a new invention, like dynamite, which when shot off from sne_i_l guns caused terrible explosions in the water like the bursting of torpedoes. This new weapon was also the means of destroying one of the enemy's torpedo boats, sending it into space seemingly leaving nothing behind. We are fortunate in possessing this instrument of offence and defence, and its destructive effects have evidently created fear in the hearts of the enemy, who immediately retreated in haste when they found out the nature of the shots sent at them.

This is no place for them."
