page 2	THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND TH E SANITARY BOARD
page 2	The letter from the Chamber of Commerce to the Government on the insanitary condition of Hongkong, dated the 19th October last, which we republish in another column, deserves very careful consideration at the hands of all those who are interested in the sanitation of the colony and in the future of the Sanitary Board. It is of special importance at the moment when the fate of our first essay in the work of local self-government seems trembling in the balance.

page 3	Having regard to the foregoing the Comities of this Chamber are unhesitatingly of opinion that, whilst it is almost certain the plague was introduced from the neighboring province, it was only in this City that it was able to germinate and to become an unparalleled disaster, and that, therefore, it was due to preventable causes. The neglect of all effective sanitary measures throughout a period of years, and in the face of continuous and repeated protest, it makes abundantly manifest that there bas been no effective administrative sanitary system in this colony.
