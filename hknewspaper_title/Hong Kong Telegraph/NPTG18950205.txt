page 2	The second performance of "Robinson Crusoe" took place last night at the Citv Hall under the patronage of Commodore Boyes, R.N., and the officers of H.M.'S Fleet. The audience was a large and enthusiastic one, and insisted on numerous encores which would have been better omitted considering the tedious length of the pantomime. It has, however, been considerably curtailed since the first performance, and last night had much more originality and "go" about it. The "Jolly Jacks," thickly sprinkled among the audience, thoroughly appreciated the pointed and rather "chic" hits aimed at them by the ubiquitous O'Brady.
