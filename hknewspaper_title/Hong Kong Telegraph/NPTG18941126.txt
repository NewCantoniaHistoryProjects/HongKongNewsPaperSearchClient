page 3	At no o'clock on Wednesday night last a fire broke out in a joss house altitude by fire the city. As the house had no chance to spread to the enighouring houses so that, the con-flagellation died away after destroying the joss house. We hear that the death of a native occurred on this occasion through a fall from a ladder which he had climbed to salve a lantern hanging from the roof.
