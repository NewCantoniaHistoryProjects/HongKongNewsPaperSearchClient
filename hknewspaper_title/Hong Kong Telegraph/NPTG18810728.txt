page 4	MR. MOORE BEGS TO RECOMMEND HIS GOGO SHAMPOO WASH TO THE PUBLIE AS UNRIVALLED BY ANY PREPARATION EVER PRO DUCED FOR PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF THE HAIR. THE BASIS OF THIS COMPOUND IS MADE OF SOAP ROOT; THE NATIVES OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE FOR WASHING THEIR HAIR; THEY ARE NEVER FOUND BALD, AND IT IS QUITE COMMON TO SEE THE FEMALES WITH HAIR FROM 5 TO 6 FEET LONG.
