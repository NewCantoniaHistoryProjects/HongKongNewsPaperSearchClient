page 3	THE STOCK OF THE HONGKONG AND CHINA BAKERY CO. LIMITED WOULD APPEAR TO BE LOOKING UP. AFTER STANDING FOR MONTHS AT 42 WITHOUT A SINGLE SHARE CHANGING HANDS IT EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN RISE, AND AT THE ADVANCED RATE OF 50, WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS PAR, A FAIR AMOUNT OF BUSINESS, AS RECORDED BY US A FEW DAYS AGO, IS BOOKED. WE HAVE AGAIN TO CHRONICLE A FEW MORE TRANSFERS IN THIS STOCK, WHICH, ALTHOUGH THE QUOTATION REMAINS AS BEFORE, WOULD APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY HAS MUCH IMPROVED LATELY.
