page 3	A LARGE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS HAS BEEN TRANSACTED IN BANKS AND DOCKS SINCE OUR LAST ISSUE.THERE WAS QUITE A RUSH ON THE DOCK COMPANY'S STOCK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON,AND THEY QUICKLY ADVANCED FROM 53 TO 55.THERE ARE STILL BUVERS AT THE LAST QUOTED PRICE;BUT HOLDERS OF SCRIP STAND OUT FOR 56,AND WE BELIEVE THAT SEVERAL SALES FOR CASH HAVE BEEN EFFECTED.BUYERS AT 57 FOR JULY ARE PLENTIFUL ENOUGH,AND IT LOOKS AS IF THE STOCK WILL STILL GO HIGHER.
