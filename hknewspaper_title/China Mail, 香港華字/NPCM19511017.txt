page 4	IT was a relief to board the Renown. The splendid ship lay alongside the quay. Adml. Pound was already on board having come through direct from Washington. He bore himself as crect as ever, and no one looking at him would have dreamed that he was stricken. I invited him to join us at my table on the homeward voyage, but he said he would prefer to take his meals in his cabin with his staff officer. Within half an hour we sailed, and for the next six days we zigzgged our way across the ocean.

page 7	Dr Powdermaker is an American anthropologist who, having published studies of the Stone Age culture of the Pacific and the Deep South culture of Mississippi, turned in 1946 to the celluloid culture of California. Regarding a film-producer as no less interesting than an ex-cannibal chief, she organised a field-trip to Hollywood and examined the society which makes the movies. Her sample of 300 people included writers and directors, actors and big bosses and publicity men: she talked to the successful and the unsuccessful attended guild meetings, watched on the set and went to parties. At the end of a year she came to the conclusion that Holly-word is hell.
