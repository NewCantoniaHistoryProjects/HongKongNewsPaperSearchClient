page 2	THE "MCRNING STAR" VERSUS CHINA
page 2	The delightful assumption of the slaughter etc. of some thousands of innocent people being justified by the fact of the taipings having met with resistance, is amusing on the part of a missionary advocate, but the best has yet to come he adds the interesting statement that "some one" had added the words "may it spread over the whole earth" under a scroll beariug the words, "the pure religion of jesus." Having in his first paragraph described the taiping idea of the "pure religion of jesus" we do not see the beauty of the addition. But there is no proof that these words were not added by one of the very converts massacred by the christian and peaceful taipings.
