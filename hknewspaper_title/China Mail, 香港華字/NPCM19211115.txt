page 7	THE MAINICHI PUBLISHED A TABLE GIVING PARTICULARS OF BRITAIN'S, AMERICA'S AND JAPAN'S OVERSEAS TRADES FROM JANUARY, COMPARED WITH THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF LAST YEAR, AND SAYS THAT THOUGH THE TRADE OF EACH OF THE COUNTRIES SHOWS AN APPROXIMATELY SIMILAR DECREASE A MORE MINUTE OBSERVATION DISCOVERS CERTAIN PECULIAR TIES. THAT JAPAN'S IMPORT TRADE SHOWS A MUCH SMALLER DECREASE THAN HER EXPORT TRADE INDICATES THAT PRICES IN JAPAN ARE MORE SLOWER IN DECLINING THAN IN THE TWO OTHER CONHTRIES.
